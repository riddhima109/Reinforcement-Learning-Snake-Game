The `plot` function in code is designed to visualize the performance of your reinforcement learning agent during training. Here’s a detailed explanation of its components and how it works:

### Components and Functionality

1. **Interactive Mode (`plt.ion()`):**
   - `plt.ion()` enables interactive mode in Matplotlib. This allows for dynamic updates to the plot without blocking the execution of the script. It is useful for visualizing real-time changes in training metrics.

2. **Function Definition (`plot(scores, mean_scores)`):**
   - **Parameters:**
     - `scores`: A list of scores obtained from each game played by the agent.
     - `mean_scores`: A list of average scores over time, providing insight into the agent’s performance trend.

3. **Plotting and Display:**
   - **Clear Previous Output:**
     - `display.clear_output(wait=True)` clears the previous output from the notebook cell. This ensures that only the most recent plot is displayed, avoiding clutter.

   - **Display the Current Figure:**
     - `display.display(plt.gcf())` displays the current figure in the notebook. `plt.gcf()` gets the current figure (the one being modified).

   - **Clear the Plot:**
     - `plt.clf()` clears the current plot, preparing it for new data. This avoids overlaying new plots on top of old ones.

   - **Plot Title and Labels:**
     - `plt.title('Training...')`: Sets the title of the plot.
     - `plt.xlabel('Number of Games')`: Labels the x-axis.
     - `plt.ylabel('Score')`: Labels the y-axis.

   - **Plot Data:**
     - `plt.plot(scores)`: Plots the scores obtained from each game.
     - `plt.plot(mean_scores)`: Plots the average scores over time.

   - **Set Y-Axis Limit:**
     - `plt.ylim(ymin=0)`: Ensures the y-axis starts at 0 to better visualize the score trends.

   - **Annotate Points:**
     - `plt.text(len(scores)-1, scores[-1], str(scores[-1]))`: Annotates the most recent score on the plot.
     - `plt.text(len(mean_scores)-1, mean_scores[-1], str(mean_scores[-1]))`: Annotates the most recent mean score on the plot.

   - **Show Plot:**
     - `plt.show(block=False)`: Displays the plot without blocking the rest of the script execution.
     - `plt.pause(.1)`: Introduces a short pause to allow the plot to update. This is crucial for dynamic visualization.

### Summary

The `plot` function updates the plot dynamically to show the scores of your reinforcement learning agent over time. It helps in monitoring the training process by visualizing how the agent's performance evolves with each game. This visualization can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the agent's learning and help identify trends or issues during training.
